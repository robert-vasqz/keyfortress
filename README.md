# KeyFortress
## Class project for IS 4543
The project, "KeyFortress," aims to develop a simple password manager and payment method storage application. This project serves as an opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience in several key areas of software development and cybersecurity, including user interface design, data management, encryption, and project planning.
